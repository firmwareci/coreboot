	help
	  Select this option to add functionality to the build to tell the
	  resource allocator about the MMIO regions configured in the data
	  fabric registers so that it knows in which regions it can properly
	  allocate the non-fixed MMIO devices.

config SOC_AMD_COMMON_BLOCK_DATA_FABRIC_DOMAIN_MULTI_PCI_ROOT
	bool
	depends on SOC_AMD_COMMON_BLOCK_DATA_FABRIC_DOMAIN
	help
	  On AMD SoCs with more than one PCI root, make sure to only report the
	  PCI bus number, IO, and MMIO resources that get decoded to a specific
	  PCI root in the corresponding coreboot domain. This will make sure
	  that the allocation the resoucre allocator calculates will be decoded
	  correctly to the PCI roots. In order for coreboot to know the correct
	  mapping, the coreboot domain numbers must be set to the corresponding
	  data fabric destination ID. On AMD systems with only one PCI root,
	  this isn't needed and even though selecting this option works when
	  the coreboot domain numbers are set up correctly, some link-time
	  optimizations won't be possible, so it's preferable to only select
	  this option on SoCs with multiple PCI roots.

config SOC_AMD_COMMON_BLOCK_DATA_FABRIC_MULTI_PCI_SEGMENT
	bool
	depends on SOC_AMD_COMMON_BLOCK_DATA_FABRIC_DOMAIN
	help
	  Some AMD SoCs support more than one PCI segment with 256 buses. Those
	  SoCs however have a different data fabric register layout for the PCI
	  bus number decoding. SoCs that use a data fabric register pair for
	  the PCI bus number which includes the segment number must select this
	  option; SoCs that use one data fabric register for the PCI bus number
	  which doesn't include a segment number field mustn't select this.
